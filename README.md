## Installation
Libraries used: `numpy`, `pandas`, `json`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`, `wordcloud`,`itertools`,`math`

`active_session` is imported from the script `workspace_utils.py`

## Project Motivation
This is part of my capstone project for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program. 

After exploring simulated data from Starbucks app, I decided to build a model that predicts whether a user will respond to a received offer.

## File Descriptions
`Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing Python code used for analysis
`portfolio.json`: JSON file provided by Udacity, contains information on each offer
`profile.json`: JSON file provided by Udacity, contains customer profile information
`transcript.json`: JSON file provided by Udacity, contains records of Starbucks app events
`workspace_utils.py`: script that helps to keep Udacity workspace from going idle

## Results
The results of this analysis are laid out in this post [here](https://gnahss.medium.com/predicting-customer-responsiveness-to-offers-75490fd63424).

## Acknowledgements
Data was provided by Udacity as part of its Data Scientist Nanodegree Program
